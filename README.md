Before running this application, ensure you have installed the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Angular CLI
- Your preferred SQL database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Setting Up the Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd backend
   ```

2. Configure the database:
   - Open `application.properties` in `src/main/resources` and update the database URL, username, and password.

3. Build and run the backend server:

   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the Angular application:
